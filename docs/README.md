# Docs

Short operational notes for bootstrapping and maintenance.

- `bootstrap-secrets.md`: manual secret creation steps (used if you need custom values or offline setup).

Notes:
- The primary bootstrap flow is in the root `README.md`.
- If you change core workflows, update both the root README and any relevant docs here.
